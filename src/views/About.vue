		<h3>Note from the owner</h3>
		<p>
			Thank you for checking us out! Tundra Feed and Supply Company is a passion
			project for me. This is a company of only me, with the goal of
			"over-delivering" in what I/"we" build. I strive to make every piece of
			software developed something which impresses and improves the day of the
			user. Please feel free to reach out to us anytime at
			<a href="mailto:support@tundrafeedandsupply.com"
				>support@tundrafeedandsupply.com</a

		<p>
			Outside of Tundra Feed and Supply Company, I am a full-stack software
			engineer at AltSource. I graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science
			from University of Adelaide in South Australia, Australia. Previous to
			that, I studied game development out of Media Design School in Auckland,
			New Zealand.
